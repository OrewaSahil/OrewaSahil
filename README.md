- Hey there, I’m Davinder

🎮 Game Developer in the making — exploring the art of creating fun, interactive worlds.
💡 Currently learning Godot and Unity, and sharpening my skills in C++.
🚀 I love experimenting with game mechanics, coding prototypes, and turning ideas into reality.
🤝 Open to collaborating on small indie games or creative projects that push imagination.
