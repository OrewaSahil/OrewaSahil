- Hey there, I’m Davinder

🎮 Game Developer in the making — exploring the art of creating fun, interactive worlds.
 Currently learning Godot and Unity, and sharpening my skills in C++.
 I love experimenting with game mechanics, coding prototypes, and turning ideas into reality.
 Open to collaborating on small indie games or creative projects that push imagination.

Fun fact: I can spend hours perfecting a single frame of animation — because details matter.
